Transparency is a unique set of seminars and hands-on workshops that bring new technology and design ideas to the Columbia Journalism community. Our goal is simple â€” help students learn new ways to find and tell stories, new ways to inform and entertain. Each topic will commence with a Friday evening panel discussion and will follow with a Saturday hands-on workshop centered around building.

Students attending three of the seminar-workshops over the course of the year will receive a graduation award indicating the extra breadth they sought out during their time at the J-School.
